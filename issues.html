<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; color: #8c0d17;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; color: #273a80; background-color: transparent;">ECONOMIC REDEVELOPMENT</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;">Business and commercial interests are critical partners in Arlington's success. A healthy commercial sector has enabled our community to pay for investments in schools, transportation and livability projects, while minimizing the tax burden on residents. But, as our high rates of commercial vacancy have indicated, federal cuts and relocation combined with growing regional competition, will test our economic resiliency in the coming years.</span> <a href="sustainable_growth">Read more...</a></span></span></p>

In the immediate, as the APS seeks to find sites to build new schools and plans renovations, I believe that the County and School Boards must work with one another - and the community - on collaborative school siting processes</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. <a href="sustainable_growth">Read more...</a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; color: #273a80; background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; color: #273a80; background-color: transparent;">PARKS AND OPEN SPACE</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; color: #273a80; background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;">As Arlington's population grows, so too does the demand for new and more intensive facilities and land uses. Talking with Arlingtonians across the County, I hear concerns about protecting parks and open space, in particular. And I believe our parks are the heart of our neighborhoods. </span></span>We need to think more rigorously about how we can preserve and grow the parks and open space we love and elevate their value in our conversations about meeting the needs of our growing population.&nbsp;<a href="sustainable_growth">Read more...</a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; color: #273a80; background-color: transparent;">TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;">Thoughtful planning around transit corridors in decades past has helped Arlington grow into a walkable, prosperous community, while still protecting choices and diversity of neighborhoods. I am committed to transportation strategies that start with people first: considering the needs of Arlingtonians not only as commuters, but as shoppers and neighbors.&nbsp;</span></span> <a href="sustainable_growth">Read more...</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; color: #8c0d17;">COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND INCLUSION<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; color: #273a80; background-color: transparent;">TRANSPARENCY &amp; COMMUNICATION</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;">We have many mechanisms for citizen engagement in Arlington, but too often, we&rsquo;re engaging the same citizens. W<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;">e need <em>all</em> of Arlington's brainpower at these tables to help develop new solutions to perennial challenges. </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;">Our challenge is more than just who we ask for input; it's also about what we do with that input when we get it. Our next Board must also take up the important work of restoring citizen confidence and trust</span></span>. <a href="inclusive_engaged_community">Read more...</a><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; color: #273a80; background-color: transparent;">ARLINGTON WOMEN &amp; FAMILIES</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;">As a leader in Arlington&rsquo;s Commission on the Status of Women, I&rsquo;ve worked with experts and service providers in the County and region to develop a clearer picture of the lives, opportunities and challenges of women and families in the community. I will push the County Board to do more to meet the needs of all citizens and create a safe, healthy and equal community that is a model for Virginia. <a href="inclusive_engaged_community">Read more...</a><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; color: #8c0d17;">LIVABILITY AND DIVERSITY<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; color: #273a80; background-color: transparent;">HOUSING AFFORDABILITY</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;">Housing dislocation risk is a top concern for many Arlingtonians and for the long-term health of the County (nearly two in five Arlington renters surveyed last year anticipate being forced out of the community in the next five years). Continued economic vibrancy, and our capacity to attract business and employers, also depends on the continued economic and generational diversity of our residents. <a href="diversity_and_livability">Read more...</a><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; color: #273a80; background-color: transparent;">VIBRANCY THROUGH COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px; color: #4b4b4b;">The era of marquee amenities in Arlington is over. In a time of stagnation in the commercial tax base and residents' incomes, expensive projects like the Long Bridge Park aquatics center, the Artisphere and high-end dog parks have begun to attract residents' ire, not their interest. We need to shift from these large-scale recreation projects to more targeted and strategic investments in Arlington's livability. <a href="diversity_and_livability">Read more...</a></span></p>
