    <p class="h3">Arlington has been at the forefront of local environmental leadership for decades; during my tenure as Vice Chair of the Board, the County became the U.S. first-ever &ldquo;<a href="https://newsroom.arlingtonva.us/release/arlington-earns-nations-first-leed-for-communities-platinum-certification/"><strong>LEED Platinum Community</strong></a>.&rdquo; But as our global climate crisis worsens, and with Arlington County increasingly impacted by extreme weather events, I believe our community must redouble our efforts.&nbsp;</p><br/><br/>
    <p>So, as my colleagues and I prepare to adopt an update to our <strong><a href="https://environment.arlingtonva.us/energy/community-energy-plan-cep/">Community Energy Plan</a></strong>, I&rsquo;ve endorsed an aggressive target of making Arlington as a Carbon Neutral Community by 2050: a zero emissions goal, paired with a target of 100% energy from renewable sources. This target assumes action not just from the County itself - such as electrification of our vehicle fleets and achievement of net-zero public buildings - but also partnership from the private sector and advances in both the markets and state regulatory landscape surrounding renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Above all, I will continue the fight for a <strong><a href="https://www.katiecristol.com/transit">sustainable public transit system</a></strong>, which is an essential, foundational element to our region&rsquo;s ability to grow in population without adding more cars, sprawl and emissions. Accessible transit also matters deeply for equity and social and economic opportunity &ndash; goals that have become increasingly, and admirably, intertwined with the environmental movement in this era of the &ldquo;Green New Deal.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>In addition to reducing emissions and adopting alternative forms of energy, Arlington also has an important stewardship role for the natural resources within our 26 square miles. I&rsquo;m committed to - and excited about - implementing key features of our newly-adopted <strong><a href="http://arlingtonparks.us/psmp/main/mobile/index.html">Public Spaces Master Plan</a></strong> over the next four years, including:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exploration and development of <a href="https://www.biophiliccities.org/">&ldquo;<strong>Biophilic Cities</strong></a>&rdquo; principles and practices for Arlington, to prioritize natural spaces and features in our land use planning and site plan review processes</li>
      <li>New policies for parkland acquisition guided by areas of greatest need (i.e. high population densities and/or lower current levels of service), to make access to parks more equitable throughout Arlington</li>
    </ul>
