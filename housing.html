    <p class="h3">I believe that housing policy is among the most important things that the Arlington County Board does. Where we live, and whether we -- as young professionals, working families, new Americans, or downsizing retirees -- can afford to come to, stay, and grow in our neighborhoods has a profound influence on our local economy, as well as integration and diversity. </p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>I&rsquo;m proud of our record on housing. During my time on the County Board:</p>
<ul>
<li>We added <strong><a href="https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2018/11/FY2018-INDICATORS.pdf">over a thousand new Committed Affordable homes for our lower-income neighbors</a></strong>, bringing Arlington&rsquo;s inventory to an all time high of over eight thousand such homes.</li>
<li>We have stepped up to crisis, working to prevent affordable garden apartments from being torn down and replaced with luxury units, both by <strong><a href="https://apah.org/apah-begins-purchase-of-68-westover-apartments/">funding non-profits in buying and preserving these apartments</a></strong><em>and</em><strong><a href="https://newsroom.arlingtonva.us/release/county-board-adopts-housing-conservation-district/">by taking steps to slow this rapid by-right redevelopment</a></strong>.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve started to tackle the supply issues that underlie our lack of modestly-sized ownership housing, reforming our Zoning Ordinance to allow more &ldquo;<strong><a href="https://housing.arlingtonva.us/plans-reports/accessory-dwelling-ordinance-update/">accessory dwellings</a></strong>,&rdquo; like English basements, and to <strong><a href="https://newsroom.arlingtonva.us/release/board-eases-restrictions-on-expanding-improving-nonconforming-homes/">preserve the County&rsquo;s stock of duplexes</a></strong> into the next generation.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>But just like the Red Queen&rsquo;s country in Alice in Wonderland, here in Arlington, &ldquo;it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve made great strides, but we&rsquo;re still a long way from our goal, adopted in the 2015 Affordable Housing Master Plan, that 17.7% of our rental housing stock will be affordable by the year 2040: <strong><a href="https://spark.adobe.com/page/dcm1BLQNzbXcO/">Currently, only 8.8% of rental units are affordable to neighbors making 60% or less of the area median income</a></strong>. And it&rsquo;s hard for middle-class residents of all ages and backgrounds to buy into broad geographic swathes of the County: Since 2005, the inventory of 3-bedroom (and smaller) homes is <em>de</em>creasing in Arlington, replaced with larger and more expensive homes throughout our single-family neighborhoods.<br /><br /></p>
<p>How can we address this challenge? I am committed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Following through on, and pursue new funding sources - including new state dollars, greater philanthropic and private investment, and maintaining and, where possible, growing, local commitments to the Affordable Housing Investment Fund - to support the creation of Committed Affordable Units to prevent displacement of low-income residents as rents increase.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pursuing new zoning reforms to increase the supply of middle-class ownership housing - home types like duplexes, fourplexes and small cottages - for seniors, young people and changing families, in neighborhoods throughout the County.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Amping up regional leadership and collaboration to advocate for and reduce barriers to significantly increasing the supply of housing throughout Northern Virginia and Metro DC.</li>
<li>As past Chair of the Metro Washington Council of Government&rsquo;s Human Services Policy Committee, I&rsquo;ve advocated for COG&rsquo;s<a href="https://www.mwcog.org/newsroom/2018/09/12/new-cog-analysis-recommends-increase-in-area-housing-production/"><strong> bold goal of increasing the number of planned housing units by over 100,000 homes by 2045</strong></a>;</li>
<li>As a member of the Virginia Municipal League&rsquo;s Legislative Committee, I&rsquo;ve advocated <strong><a href="https://www.vml.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/VML-Legislative-Committee-Actions-Taken-Sept-6-2018.pdf">reform to the state proffers law</a></strong> that has hamstrung the creation of more housing in our peer jurisdictions in Northern Virginia.</li>
</ul>
