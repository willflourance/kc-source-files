    <p class="h3">Back in 2015, I ran for County Board based on my conviction that the primary campaign field - and the Board itself - needed women’s voices. In the years since, as our Commonwealth and nation have seen unprecedented numbers of women elected to office, it’s clearer that ever “women’s issues” are fundamental to our shared future. That’s why I’ve been so proud to fight for Arlington women and families over the past four years, leading major breakthroughs in childcare affordability and community response to sexual assault and domestic violence.

    <p class="h2 mt-3">Addressing Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence</p>
    <p>Building on our community&rsquo;s strong foundation of interagency partnerships, I&rsquo;ve worked through Project PEACE, on our community&rsquo;s Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) and around the region to ensure that survivors never enter &ldquo;wrong doors,&rdquo; nor have to endure long waits to receive health or evidence-collection services.</p>
<p>Project PEACE and SART achievements over the past few years include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The launch of a <strong><a href="https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2018/10/Arlington-SART-Protocols-Online.pdf">comprehensive protocol</a></strong> to ensure that survivors - and agencies - have common expectations for delivery of response and care after a traumatic event; and of the community-facing materials that educate all Arlingtonians, in <strong><a href="https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2018/09/Sexual-Assault-Resources-Response-Brochure.pdf">English</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2018/09/Sexual-Assault-Resources-Response-Brochure-Spanish.pdf">Spanish</a></strong>, about where to go for help and what to expect.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A regional partnership with INOVA to deliver a first of its kind,<strong><a href="https://www.inova.org/inova-in-the-community/fact"> 24/7 Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner-staffed unit</a></strong>, so that no survivor is diverted or delayed in accessing critical health, counseling and forensic services after an assault - the result of coordinated, regional advocacy across Northern Virginia jurisdictions to achieve grant funding.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Implementation of key partnerships to keep domestic violence victims safe, including law enforcement protocols to remove firearms after the issuance of a permanent protective order and the creation of a new <strong><a href="https://newsroom.arlingtonva.us/release/arlington-opens-safe-havens-center/">&ldquo;Safe Havens&rdquo; center for supervised visitation and exchange of children in families affected by domestic violence</a></strong>.</p>
